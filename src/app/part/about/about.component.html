      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>My interest to world of IT was begin a long time ago. When we dont has a PC, I has already
      books and magazines, and of course I readed them! This was happened I read the book from Assembly coding. Im not really
       understand what Im reading, but I like it anyway. After that I find a little book in the antiquevarium, has a title:
      Turbo Pascal to PC owner. In this case I has a success feelings, because Im write a lot of tiny little
      programs. I learned a lot of things, like variable, expression, procedure etc.
      Only one problem was here, after the end of the book, I have no options to continue. The internet does not exist in the
        nowadays format, I dont have people with programming skills, I cant ask someone for help.
        After a time I go the SysAdmin course, and I love it, but we dont learn coding.
        After a long time, I have an option, to go to Informatics Engineer course, and Im very happy,
        after I see the syllabus, because this course have a programming skill in C#!
        I love this time, I learn what I can. After end of the course 1-2 months I have
        another option, to take a course in Backend Java Developer. Of course I going!
        After this course, the best students have an opportunity to go into medior course.
